This sample solution shows designer extensions for WPF. 

Right now, we need to have .VisualStudio.Designer.dll files in the same directory as a reference file. Next objective is to move that to an extension.

# How do I see it?

Start off by building the solution. Next, open MainWindow.xaml from the TestProject project in the designer. After selecting the window, you will see a expander right next to the upper-right corner of the window.
